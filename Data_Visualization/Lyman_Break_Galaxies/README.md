# HW2: Lyman Break Galaxy Spectra Analysis

This project compares the target galaxy **cB58** to 100 SDSS spectra to identify the closest matches. I implemented a **sliding-window search** using standardized flux values and Euclidean distance, with optional smoothing to handle noisy data. The goal was to find spectra that align closely with cB58’s features.

*(This file contains the alignment plots of cB58 with the top matching spectra, along with discussion of methods and results.)*
